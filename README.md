MyToken Contract

This is the smart contract for MyToken token (JMS). It permits the tracking of balances for various addresses in addition to the minting and burning of tokens.

Open Variables

name: A string variable that holds the token's name (JAMES).
symbol: A string variable that holds the token's (JMS) symbol.
totalSupply: The total supply of tokens is represented by this unsigned integer variable.

Mapping a Variable

balances: An association between an address and its accompanying token balance.

Functions

mint(address _address, uint _value) is used to create new tokens. It adds the designated number of tokens to the balance of the specified address and raises the overall supply.

burn(address _address, uint _value): A function used to burn (destroy) tokens. It checks if the specified address has enough tokens to burn, reduces the total supply, and subtracts the specified number of tokens from the address balance.

Please note that this readme file provides a brief overview of the MyToken contract and its functionalities. For more detailed information, it is recommended to review the actual code implementation.

Note:

 Make sure to review and test the code thoroughly before deploying it on a live network.
